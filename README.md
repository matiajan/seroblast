# seroblast
BASH script for identification of S. suis serotype from draft genome

Database of serotype-specific sequences is modified from SsuisSerotyping_pipeline. Unlike SsuisSerotyping_pipeline, the seroblast is dependent only on local blast installation.

Translation to English and building blast database will follow.
